🚨 This repository was used to deploy the entire application, including both the front-end ([master-data-ui](https://github.com/AmineBarguellil7/master-data-ui)) and back-end ([master-data](https://github.com/AmineBarguellil7/master-data)), on a local Kubernetes cluster using Docker Desktop, as well as for deployment on AWS.
On 𝐀𝐖𝐒, I utilized 𝐄𝐂𝟐 𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐬 as 𝐊𝐮𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐬 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐫 𝐧𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐬 for scalable processing, deployed within 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐝𝐞𝐟𝐚𝐮𝐥𝐭 𝐕𝐏𝐂 that provided predefined subnets for simplified networking. To secure the application, I configured 𝐒𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐆𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐩𝐬 to manage traffic flow and control access to services running on the worker nodes, ensuring robust network protection and isolation.
